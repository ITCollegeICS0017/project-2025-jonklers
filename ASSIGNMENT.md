# Online Auction

Both sellers and buyers participate. Sellers list products and choose the type of sale:

Immediate sale – fixed price, time limit, description, delivery conditions.

Auction – starting bid, time limit, description, delivery conditions.

Negotiated – starting price and description, with auction staff setting other parameters.

Buyers browse categories, register, and either buy or bid.
To win an auction, a buyer must place the highest bid before the deadline.
Auction staff notify the winning bidder.
For payment, buyers choose among options (e.g., e-wallets, bank accounts).
After payment, the auction transfers money to the seller (minus commission) and provides buyer’s contact info for delivery.
